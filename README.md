# Weather-App
weather app in python using openweatherapi

To use the code, you would need to: 
⦁	Make sure you have the necessary packages installed (tkinter, timezonefinder, requests, Pillow) before running the code. 
⦁	Once you run the code, a GUI window will pop up on your screen with a "Weather App" title and a blue background. 
⦁	To get weather information for a specific city, you will need to enter the name of the city in the GUI window. 
⦁	The weather data will be retrieved once you press the "Get Weather" button below the text box. 
⦁	In the GUI window, the weather data will be presented in various labels, such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and a description of the weather. 
⦁	Furthermore, the GUI window displays the current time in the selected city and the date and time when the last data refresh took place. 
⦁	A message box will appear if you enter an invalid city name. Enter the correct city name to avoid an error message.
